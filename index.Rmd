I am currently a PhD candidate in the Neuroscience Program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work with Dr. Alison Bell on the neural mechanisms of social behaviour. 

I enjoy interdisciplinary research that integrates experimental manipulations, 'omics technologies, and molecular tools to understand how ecologically relevant behaviours are generated and evolve.
